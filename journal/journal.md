## Description
The goal is to build a baseline system that performs face verification, i.e. given two images of people, are they the same person or not.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Understand different face recognition methods and select a few architectures
- [ ] Data loaders and preprocessing
- [ ] PyTorch code for training process and model architectures
  - [ ] `/models/facerecog1.py`
  - [ ] `train.py`
- [ ] Analyze results using a Jupyter notebook
  - [ ] `analyze.ipynb`
- [ ] interpretation
