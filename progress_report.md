# Progress report

## Goal
- Train and test an adversarial method for learning fair representations of images
- Compare these results to previously used methods for face recognition (learning to identify while failing to detect)
- Extended goal: check the transferrability of these representations

## Methods
- For training the network: pytorch

## Work accomplished
- Initial training of a baseline face recognition system under way

## Remaining Work
- Everything else? lol
