## Day 1: Monday 28th May
### Work accomplished
- Shuffled the text files so that websites do not block
- Downloaded 10000 images total (5000 actors, 5000 actresses)
- Wrote down details in download_commands.txt

### Questions raised
- Does training happen on the full image or only on the cropped portion of faces?
- How does one even train a GAN? (Also, same question as above)
- Should try and contact original paper authors to obtain exact methods
